### Word trainer  

This is a pet project on which I worked to train my German vocabulary.  
The words are translated to French.

This is a web application using TypeScript and plain vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript.  
The database used is MongoDB.

### To start the application

Pull the repository.  

Install the dependencies using `npm install`.  

Run the web server with `nodemon`.  

Access the web page at https://localhost:3000  

Train your German vocabulary!
